<b style="font-size: 22px" id="CallForResearchPapers">Industry Track - Call for Contributions</b>

The goal of the ICSOB 2022 Industry Track is to present research results within the conference scope tailored for industry participants. This track will receive two different kinds of submissions: tutorials and talks. Submissions can be made at <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icsob2022" target="_blank">EasyChair submission system</a>.

<p>
<b style="font-size: 18px">Call for Tutorials</b></p>
The objective of the tutorials is to present content related to the conference scope in a didactic way for the ICSOB participants. The tutorials will happen during the main conference days and might have a duration of 180 or 90 minutes. <br>
Optionally, from 5 to 8 pages of unpublished material from the accepted tutorials might be included in the Companion Proceedings. In this case, proposals should follow the CEUR-ART one column template which is available here: <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip" target="_blank">http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip</a> (LaTeX) or <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEUR-Template-1col.docx" target="_blank">http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEUR-Template-1col.docx</a> (Word). We are aiming to submit the ICSOB 2022 Companion Proceedings, including the Tutorials papers to CEUR-WS.org for online publication. Please note, there may be some restrictions regarding the volume of papers published via CEUR-WS.org which may prevent the online publication of tutorial papers.
