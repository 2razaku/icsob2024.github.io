<b class="display-4" style="text-align: center;">Theme of the year: Software for Digital Transformation </b>

Digital transformation has become a key priority for businesses to evolve to continuously changing market demands. Digital transformations typically require deep organizational, structural, cultural, and technological change in order to survive. This can fundamentally redefine key organizational activities and values in response to new opportunities through the exploration and exploitation of software business and innovation. Yet, the ongoing acceleration of digital technologies in todayâ€™s software-enabled business environment poses not only opportunities but also major challenges for organizations to continuously invest in and embed digital transformations merely to survive and compete.

The theme of ICSOB2022 is <b>Software for Digital Transformation</b>. Research about software for digital transformations addresses a wide range of concerns ranging from software products, software teams, software deployment, software startups, agility, strategy and business models, among many others. As a contemporary topic, digital transformation presents an intersection between the software engineering, information systems, and business communities.
