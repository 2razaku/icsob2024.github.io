<b id="long1">An instrument for evaluating data-driven traffic
management applications in the context of digital
transformation towards a smart city</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>The smart city concept represents an integrated approach for mitigating the challenges resulting from ongoing urbanization by synergizing technology, data, and citizens in a sustainable manner. Smart mobility is an important
aspect of a smarty city with intelligent traffic management as one of its key enablers that can contribute to making cities more attractive for living. In this article
we focus on data-driven applications for traffic management and develop a new
instrument for their evaluation, sharing insights from a municipal project. Drawing on digital business research, evaluation models and expertise from traffic
management, we develop criteria and apply them to a Weighted Sum Model, an
established modeling technique. As a result, we obtain an easy-to-use instrument
for evaluating data-driven applications that can also be adjusted to other contexts.
Therefore, both our instrument and the process we employed in its development
can support future smart city initiatives in their instrument development and evaluation process.</li>

<b id="long2">Overcoming Barriers to Digital Transformation –
Development of a Decision Matrix</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>Digital Transformation (DT) impacts industries, non-profit sectors,
higher education, and even societies. As connectivity technologies blend with
physical assets, modifications in value creation processes are provoked. These
modifications may have positive impacts such as higher effectivity, enhanced
business models, and improved customer connection. However, realizing a DT
is a complex endeavor. Specific properties, so-called barriers, hinder the DT journey. Thus, it is essential to grasp the barriers and indicate ways to overcome them.
We develop a decision matrix for overcoming barriers using qualitative data from
participants working in different sectors. This work builds upon a pre-study developing a barrier classification and enhances it with specific recommendations
such as “define clear DT responsibilities”. Thus, our work takes the development
of plain barrier classifications further. From a theoretical perspective, this work
contributes to developing hypothetical models of the effects of recommendations
to overcome barriers in the future. From a practical perspective, companies can
use the recommendations to plan actions to take.</li>

<b id="long3">Digital Twin Ecosystems: Potential Stakeholders and
Their Requirements</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>Context: As industries are heading for digital transformation through Industry
4.0, the concept of Digital Twin (DT) - a software for digital transformation, has
become popular. Many industries use DT for its advantages, such as predictive
maintenance and real-time remote monitoring. Within DT domain, an emerging
topic is the concept of an ecosystem—a digital platform that would create value
for different stakeholders in an ecosystem of DT-driven products and services.
The identification of potential stakeholders and their requirements provides valuable contributions to the development of healthy Digital Twin Ecosystems
(DTE). However, current empirical knowledge of potential stakeholders and
their requirements are limited.<br>
Objective/Methodology: Thus, the objective of this research was to explore potential stakeholders and their requirements. The research employed an empirical
research methodology in which semi-structured interviews were conducted with
DT professionals for data collection.<br>
Results: Data analysis of the study revealed 13 potential stakeholders who were
categorized as primary (manufacturers, suppliers, subcontractors, and intelligent
robots), secondary (maintenance service providers, platform integration service
providers, tech companies, etc.), and tertiary (research organizations, third-party
value-added service providers, cyber security firms, etc.). This study also presents the different requirements of these stakeholders in detail.<br>
Contribution: The study contributes to both research and industry by identifying
possible stakeholders and their requirements. It contributes to the literature by
adding new knowledge on DTEs and fills a research gap while contributing industry by providing ample knowledge to the industry’s practitioners that is useful
in the development and maintenance of a healthy DTE.</li>

<b id="long4">Definition of the enterprise integration platforms
as a service — Towards a common understanding</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>Integration platforms are modern way to governance, develop and deploy integrations, the connections and data transferring between systems. Integration platforms can be build as an in-house solution, but nowadays the more common way is to buy enterprise integration platforms as a service (EiPaaS/iPaaS) product. However, integration platforms are evolving fast and in our literature review we found
out that the definition in the academic research about enterprise integration platforms as a service is outdated. For that, we created a new
definition to describe more the capabilities, importance and evolution
of enterprise integration platforms as a service by analyzing the leading
EiPaaS product descriptions. Our results helps academics and companies
gain further understanding about the enterprise integration platforms as
a service solutions.</li>

<b id="long5">Roadmapping in the Digital Transformation Literature</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>Digital transformation is vital for organizations in all sectors, as it
changes value creation, customer relationships, and internal processes. A key
concern in digital transformations is creating and executing an effective strategy
that reimagines the organization. However, structured approaches for
reimagination in a digital transformation are still missing. This paper contributes
to this concern by reviewing how roadmapping is used in the digital
transformation literature. Roadmapping is a flexible technique to support the
strategic formulation of short- and long-range changes to software, business,
organizational and structural aspects. Reviewing 28 papers on digital
transformation, we uncovered five types of roadmapping for reimagining
organizations: Product-Technology, Strategy, Business, Data, and Design. For
these five types, we unfold the landscape of obstacles, opportunities, and context
for different pathways to successfully reimagining organizations in digital
transformations</li>

<b id="long6">A Systematic Mapping Study of Empirical Research
Methods in Software Ecosystems</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>The field of software ecosystems is rapidly maturing and significant
numbers of articles are published each year to further develop our understanding
of this concept and support innovation through it. The growth of the field also
brings along challenges, such as findability and reusability of research results,
coordination of research initiatives, and significant review pressure on members
of the community. In this mapping study of empirical research methods in the
field, we show that few studies do a good job of reporting their research methods
and results. Using data from the study, we provide guidelines for performing empirical research in software ecosystems.</li>

<b id="long7">Interrelation of Digitalization and Digital
Transformation in a Maritime company</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>Many organizations must undergo digitalization and digital
transformation (DT) simultaneously; in itself, either is daunting. For 15
months, we followed the ongoing digitalization and DT activities at a
maritime company with over 3700 employees through a qualitative analysis of 20 interviews, a workshop, and several documents. We see how
digitalization and DT are inherently interrelated; DT and digitalization
have common enablers through technology such as AI, and common processes in continuous software development. They also share many challenges, including lack of resources and internal resistance against change.
Through acquiring data in the digitalization of core services, companies
can undergo DT by utilizing data in new and profound ways to build services with new value propositions. In conclusion, digitalization and DT
are necessary for incumbent companies and require careful balancing of
resources, competence, and technology</li>

<b id="long8">Where Does This Feature Belong To? Locating Businessto-Business Features in a Platform Ecosystem</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>The question of how software development needs are channeled into
different parts of a platform ecosystem has been addressed by separating owners
and complementors and by separating the core and the periphery. This is not necessarily sufficient in business-to-business ecosystems due to their characteristics.
Our grounded theory study observes a B2B platform that brings together multiple
stakeholders and their software development. This paper describes the location
aspect in decision making, what feature gets implemented in which part of the
ecosystem and on what grounds. We refer to this decision of implementation location as feature demarcation. We describe the related structures and discuss why
the location matters. Our work complements the existing research with an addition to the core-periphery view. In the process of situating a new feature we observe the architectural elements together instead of focusing on distinct entities.</li>

<b id="long9">The Role of Actors in Platform Ecosystems: A Systematic
Literature Review and Comparison Across Platform</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>The information systems literature has acknowledged the importance
of external actors for the success of platform ecosystems. Thus far, these actors
have either been studied on a particular platform type or have been generalized
across multiple platform types. We see opportunities in scrutinizing the varying
roles that actors play on platforms of different types. For instance, actors who
develop third-party applications are hardly comparable to actors that sell physical
goods on an electronic marketplace. We conducted a systematic literature review
and compared actors and their activities across different platform types. Specifically, we analyzed 68 scientific studies and distilled five platform types: social
media platforms, e-commerce platforms, sharing platforms, crowdsourcing platforms, and software platforms. Next, we analyzed the actors that engage on those
platforms and found that each platform type is associated with a specific set of
actors: e-commerce platforms involve sellers and buyers, sharing platforms involve lenders and borrowers, crowdsourcing platforms involve workers and
crowdsourcers and software platforms involve application developers and users.
On social media platforms, actors occupy a double role as prosumers. Additionally, we investigated the interactions between these actor types and found that
same-side interactions are especially prevalent among application developers
who share knowledge with one another. The main contribution of our study is a
comparative overview on platform types, actors and activities.</li>

<b id="long10">Towards understanding how software startups
deal with UX from customer and user information</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>Customer-centric strategies can help startups move towards
successful and sustainable businesses. User eXperience (UX) has been
considered a critical factor in creating value for the customers and users
of startups. Software startups often collect data about the experience
with the product from users. However, obtaining valuable insights to
improve the UX from customer and user information can be challenging for startup professionals. In this paper, we present a multiple-case
study conducted with Brazilian software startups in which we investigated how these companies deal with customer and user information. To
collect data, we conducted semi-structured interviews and retrospective
meetings with 28 professionals from the four startups. We found that the
startups still need to improve their strategies to leverage customer and
user information insights for continuous product improvement, including improving communication channels and adopting metrics to assess
customer value creation and product success. As a result, this study can
motivate startup professionals to reflect on the most efficient practices
for collecting and managing UX information to improve their products
and measure value creation.</li>

<b id="long11">The Evolution of Software Startup Research: A
Survey of Literature</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>The software startup research area has grown rapidly in the
recent years. It is widely known that building software startups are challenging endeavors, and the failure rate is high. However, the fascinating
phenomenon keeps getting interest from academics to address those challenges, due to the potential of software startups as an effective way for
disruptive innovation. The aim of this study is to provide an update on
the evolution of the software startup research area through a systematic
mapping study. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we provide a mapping of current research in software startups in terms of contributing disciplines and research methods and theories used. The second contribution
is the identification of two new and emerging research streams termed
Software Startup Education and Ethics in Software Startups. Furthermore, the findings allow us to update the research agenda and provide
new examples of research questions to advance the software startup research area.</li>

<b id="short1">On the Characteristics of Internal Software
Startups</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>In recent years, more attention has been given to internal
software startups in practice and in research alike, yet the concept is not
fully understood. Nor is it clear whether or not it significantly differs
from stand-alone software startup, and if yes, then how. In this position
paper, we propose to conceptualize internal software startups as a hybrid
of two related concepts: stand-alone software startup and internal corporate venture (ICV). We derive characteristics of the both concepts from
the earlier literature and use our previous research on internal software
startups to uncover the differences and the similarities across the three
concepts.</li>

<b id="long12">On the Compliance of Platforms with Children’s Privacy and Protection Requirements - An Analysis of TikTok</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>During Covid-19 pandemic, social media platforms such as
Youtube Kids and TikTok perceived a growing audience, as their videos
became part of child and preteen culture. However, the children’s lack
of digital literacy limits their understanding of privacy-related risks on
these platforms. Besides, the misleading design of platforms services (e.g.
features that favour advertising partners and retain young audiences in
the ecosystem) together with limited enforcement of policies and terms
of use by tech companies affect children’s protection. This paper presents
18 legal requirements (LR) for children’s privacy and protection by platforms. We illustrate their application by examining TikTok, the most
popular social media platform among children. We collected TikTok’s
documentation and evidence from relevant media and IT news websites
to classify the compliance of its practices with these LR, which can guide
platforms in implementing children’s privacy and data protection</li>

<b id="long13">Democratizing Software Development: A Systematic
Multivocal Literature Review and Research Agenda on
Citizen Development</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>While the ongoing digital transformation is boosting the demand for
digital solutions and digital skills, organizations worldwide experience a shortage
of IT professionals and particularly software developers. At the same time, the
increasing prevalence of low-code development platforms (LCDP) allows organizations to introduce citizen development initiatives to promote and accelerate
their digital transformations. Citizen development represents a novel software
engineering paradigm which enables and supports the development of software
by non-IT professionals, consequently referred to as ‘citizen developers’. While
there is a vivid discourse on citizen development in the practice community, research on this phenomenon is still scarce. We conducted a systematic multivocal
literature review including research and practice publications, and identified six
key themes: 1) definition and characteristics of citizen development, 2) enablers
and expected benefits of citizen development, 3) challenges of and criticism towards citizen development, 4) citizen development strategy and implementation,
5) citizen development governance, and 6) citizen developers’ profiles and skills.
Moreover, we propose a research agenda for future work on citizen development.
Our research contribution is to synthesize the existing knowledge on citizen development and to point out future avenues to propel research on this emerging
and contemporary phenomenon</li>

<b id="long14">Management Accounting Concepts for Inner
Source Software Engineering</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>Inner source software development is the use of open source
development’s best practices inside a company. In inner source, developers collaborate on reusable software components across company-internal
organizational silo boundaries for mutual benefit. As such, inner source
goes against the grain of traditional management techniques. In this article, we present two conceptual models of management accounting for
inner source. We derived these prototypes by performing a literature
review and triangulating the results with interviews of industry practitioners. We demonstrate how the conceptual models can be used for
monitoring and controlling inner source projects and to determine their
future viability.</li>

<b id="long15">DevOps challenges in organizations:
Through professional lens</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>DevOps is a set of organizational practices as well as a culture which
tries to eliminate the barriers between the Devs and Ops teams, improve the
collaboration and communication among teammates. DevOps is used in different
organizations because it supports quicker production, stability and reliability for
software development. While the success factors of DevOps adoption have been
studied in the extant literature, also the perceived challenges that a company faces
during the adoption are crucial to discover. This paper explores and highlights
these challenges through an open ended survey (N=15) and in-depth interviews
with DevOps professionals (N=16). According to the findings, there are various
challenges while implementing DevOps in the organizations. The research suggests
that (i) lack of team coordination, (ii) risky change and development, (iii) team
members expertise level, (iv) lack of focus or differences in development, (v)
test and production environment, (vi) poorly defined functional and technical
requirements, (vii) poor integration and test process, (viii) pipeline execution
problems, (ix) tools integration challenges, (x) people challenges and silo-ed
thinking, (xi) debugging challenges due to remote execution, (xii) feature release
challenges, (xiii) integrating new standards, (xiv) challenges with clients, (xv)
knowledge sharing, (xvi) responsibility distribution issues are the challenges while
using DevOps. The founded list of perceived challenges will help future research to
suggest mitigation and risk management strategies for successful use of DevOps.</li>

<b id="short2">Quō vādis, Data Business? A Study for understanding maturity of embedded
system companies in data economy</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>Data has been claimed to be the new oil of the 21st century as it has
seen to be able both to improve the existing products and services as well as to
create new revenue streams for its utilizing company with a secondary customers
base. However, while there is active streams of research for developing machine
learning and data science methods, considerably less has been done to understand
and characterize data business activities in the software-intensive companies. This
study uses a multiple case study approach in the software-intensive embedded
system domain. Four large international embedded system companies were selected
as the case study subjects. The objective is to understand how the case companies
are developing their activities for successful utilization of the data. The study
identifies six distinct stages with their own challenges. In addition, this study serves
as a starting for further work for supporting software-intensive embedded system
companies to start data business.</li>

project-based learning environment - The case of
WIMMA lab</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>Increasing ethical concerns necessitate AI ethics forms part of practical software engineering (SE) foundational educational learn- ing. Using an ethnographic approach and focus group discussions in a SE project-based learning environment, WIMMA lab, we gain insight into how AI ethics can be implemented to enable students to acquire these necessary skills. We propose a framework as an outcome to aid the implementation of AI ethics skills within SE project-based learning environments.

<b id="short4">Conducting B2B SaaS Business with a Freemium Model: A Case Study</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>This article studies what are the characteristics of a B2B SaaS freemium firm. Freemium in a B2B setting is an under-explored phenomenon
whereas B2C SaaS freemium has been studied extensively. On the consumer side
freemium has played a big role but freemium has only recently started to enter
the B2B environment. Traditional, sales-led B2B SaaS companies have increasingly begun to turn to freemium and hence, it is important to understand how do
they go about it. The empirical qualitative research was conducted as a case study
and the data was gathered by interviewing European B2B SaaS freemium businesses. The data was analysed using qualitative thematic analysis and the coding
approach used for identifying the concepts was open coding and axial coding.
From the data three main success factor themes emerged that were evident in the
B2B environment: customer success, internal enablers and external enablers. </li>

<b id="long16">Increasing Employees’ Willingness to Share:
Introducing Appeal Strategies for People Analytics</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>Increasingly digital workplaces enable advanced people analytics (PA)
that can improve work, but also implicate privacy risks for employees. These
systems often depend on employees sharing their data voluntarily. Thus, to leverage the potential benefits of PA, companies have to manage employees’ disclosure decision. In literature, we identify two main strategies: increase awareness or apply appeal strategies. While increased awareness may lead to more conservative data handling, appeal strategies can promote data sharing. Yet, to our
knowledge, no systematic overview of appeal strategies for PA exists. Thus, we
develop an initial taxonomy of strategies based on a systematic literature review
and interviews with 18 experts. We describe strategies in the dimensions of values, benefits, and incentives. Thereby, we present concrete options to increase the
appeal of PA for employees.</li>
</ul>

<b id="long17">Anti-Pattern Detection in Process-Driven
Decision Support Systems</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>Decision makers increasingly rely on decision support systems for optimal decision making. Recently, special attention has been
paid to process-driven decision support systems (PD-DSS) in which a
process model prescribes the invocation sequence of software-based decision support services and the data exchange between them. Thus, it is
possible to quickly combine available decision support services as needed
for optimally supporting the decision making process of an individual decision maker. However, process modelers may accidentally create a process model which is technically well-formed and executable, but contains
functional and behavioral flaws such as redundant or missing services.
These flaws may result in inefficient computations or invalid decision
recommendations when the corresponding PD-DSS is utilized by a decision maker. In this paper, we therefore propose an approach to validate
functionality and behavior of a process model representing a PD-DSS.
Our approach is based on expressing flaws as anti-patterns for which the
process model can be automatically checked via graph matching. We prototypically implemented our approach and demonstrate its applicability
in the context of decision making for energy network planning.</li>

<b id="long18">An investigation of factors influencing online shopping
behaviors in the context of China and Australia</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>Online shopping has gained much popularity over the past decade.
Indeed, in a post-COVID world, online shopping is the only medium of shopping for many. A great deal of research effort has been devoted to understanding the factors that positively or negatively influence online shopping behavior
of consumers. However, most of these influence relationships have been studied
individually, and not how such factors interrelate with each other and thus the
underlying complex driving and dependence relationships among those factors
are unknown. Moreover, these underlying driving and dependence relationships
among online shopping behavior factors can be highly dependent on the cultural
context of the consumers. In this research we identify the key factors that have
been shown to have influence on online shopping behavior from a rigorous review of literature. We then apply an Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM)
technique to find the underlying complex hierarchical relations of factors related to Australian and Chinese culture. We apply MICMAC analysis to find the
driving and dependence power of these factors in context of these two cultures.
We finally explain the differences and similarities found for Australian and
Chinese culture with reference to Hofstede’s Cross Culture theory. Prominent
findings include timeliness of delivery and order accuracy is considered having
high dependence and driving power in the Australian context but has low driving and dependence power in Chinese context. Our findings will be beneficial
for including better cultural context factors into future online shopping platform
design. </li>

<b id="long19">Digital Transformation towards Sustainability: A Case
Study of Process Views in District Heating </b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>Digital transformation (DT) has the potential to change our society
toward the United Nation's sustainable development goals. However, developing
software for the DT towards sustainability is a complex process that may entail
an emphasis on optimization, eco-feedback, reflection, and participation. This
paper contributes to a better understanding of how organizations navigate this
complexity of different process views with a case study of a DT in district heating. Based on ten interviews with a software development company, eight interviews with a district heating supplier, and 14 interviews with consumers, we analyze the process views on their DT. This analysis shows how organizations navigate the different process views in a DT journey when encountering and solving
problems. We conclude the paper by providing propositions on what navigating
DT implies. Furthermore, we discuss how these insights can help practitioners
navigate different process views and how our findings nuance the understanding
of the DT process.</li>

<b id="short5">Gender Bias in the Recruitment Process of IT
Startups in the Netherlands</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>In today’s fast-changing and innovative world, startups must
compete amongst themselves and other well-established companies to
hire the best talent in order to succeed. Diversity within the recruitment
process is typically not a priority, even though it is well known that a
diverse team is beneficial for (business) outcomes. Through a multiple
case study performed at 5 IT startups based in the Netherlands, we
observed that gender bias is introduced from the first moment that the
need for an employee has been identified until candidate hiring. This is
a direct result from (1) a lack of resources (e.g., time and money), (2)
urgency to find the first and best candidate, or (3) the awareness of the
startup founders.</li>

<b id="short6">Green ICT Adoption and Challenges: Evidence from the
Finnish ICT Sector</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>For better or worse, information, communication, and technology (ICT) is taking over
most part of our lives. During the past few years, organizations, industries, and educational and health institutions that could utilize the power of ICT and digitalization maintained high productivity, efficiency, economic and social resilience. Yet, at the same
time, the trend towards digital transformation is contributing its fair share to increased
energy consumption, e-waste, and carbon emissions. The challenge is how to ensure
that organizations successfully embark on their digital strategy with sustainability at
the center of the digital transformation. In this study, we aim to understand the motivations and needs of organizations towards adopting green ICT as a response to the
sustainable development agenda. Through an exploratory and qualitative study, we surveyed ICT-related organizations to understand their motivations and challenges to
adopting green ICT. Our findings show a lack of green ICT awareness and a vague
corporate strategy for green ICT adoption. This study provides a foundation for practitioners and policymakers to develop strategies and support systems to enhance the organizational green ICT transformation agenda.</li>
