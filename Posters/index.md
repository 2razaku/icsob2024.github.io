<b style="font-size: 22px" id="CallForResearchPapers">Posters â€“ Call for Submissions</b>

The poster track invites researchers, practitioners, and PhD students working in the area of software-intensive business to submit a poster of their research. Posters are intended to stimulate face-to-face discussions among conference participants: reflection of the past studies, descriptions of current initiatives, visions for the future and new results in software-intensive business research and practice are welcome. Poster contributions may address any topic that fits within the ICSOB2022 topics of interests, as follows:

<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px">Digital Transformation</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px">Responsible Software</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px">Software Platforms, Ecosystems, and App Stores</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px">Software Business Development</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px">Legal Issues</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px">Software Startups</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px">Citizen Development</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px">Engineering and Management</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px">Human Factors</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px">Emerging Industry Trends</li>
</ul>

The posters will be displayed all day long during the main conference (November 9-10, 2022) and at the last Industry session (November 11, 2022) co-located with <a href="https://www.sfscon.it/">SFScon</a>, allowing attendees to visit the posters at their convenience. However, authors will attend their posters only during the assigned Poster Session time frames (which will be published online when the final program is available).

<b style="font-size: 18px">Submissions</b></p>
In order to have a poster presented at the conference,  an extended abstract of up to four pages, including references, must be submitted for review by the specified deadline.  Poster submission will be reviewed by 2 members of the Program Committee via a single-blind reviewing process. The review is based on an extended abstract, which can contain smaller contributions, late breaking developments or in-progress work.
 
The extended abstract must use the CEUR-ART one column template which is available here: <a href="/assets/download/CEURART.zip" target="_blank" download>http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip</a> (LaTeX) or <a href="/assets/download/CEUR-Template-1col.docx" target="_blank" download>http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEUR-Template-1col.docx</a> (Word). All submissions should be made through EasyChair using the link: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icsob2022" target="_blank">Easychair</a>.

Participants of PhD retreat are invited to submit and present at the poster session to get more feedback from the conference attendees, without submitting the extended abstract. For those participants, they need to prepare for the poster (see the Guidelines) and may use the printing services (see the Poster Printing).

<b style="font-size: 18px">Publication of Accepted Submissions
</b></p>
We are aiming to submit the ICSOB 2022 Companion Proceedings, including the poster abstracts to <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/" target="_blank">CEUR-WS.org</a> for online publication. Please note, there may be some restrictions regarding the volume of papers published via <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/" target="_blank">CEUR-WS.org</a> which may prevent the online publication of poster abstracts.

At least one author of each accepted submission must register for the conference and present the work during the poster session.

<p>
<b style="font-size: 18px">Poster Printing

For all accepted poster abstracts, authors should prepare and bring a printed poster themselves. Free University of Bozen-Bolzano provides a service to print the poster. To avail this service, a print-ready PDF file is mandatory. All submissions should be made through a shared folder (the link will be provided later).

<b style="font-size: 18px">Guidelines for Creating Good Posters
</b></p>
Posters help you to advertise your research, fostering discussions and helping you to communicate your research ideas in an early stage. The following guidelines should help to design a good poster that fosters discussions with interested members of the audience:
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li><b>Layout:</b></li>
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 6px">Poster size is A1 (594 mm x 841 mm). The poster should have an ample supply of push-pins
</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 6px">Poster should have a portrait, no landscape layout
</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 6px">Consider borders during the print if you design your poster in tools such as Microsoft Powerpoint
</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 6px">The scale for images should be 1/1 so they do not appear stretched</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li><b>Content:</b></li>
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 6px">Poster contains the title, author(s), affiliation(s) and contact information of the main author
</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 6px">All materials on the poster should be easily readable from more than 1m away
</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 6px">In general, posters should be self-supporting. Make sure your poster is structured logically, from top to bottom or with a similar easy-to-follow logical structure. Try to reach a balanced mix of text and graphical content
</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 6px">Be concise and brief as possible. Illustrations, graphics, and figures greatly increase readability. Minimise narrative and long paragraphs. Bullet lists are also a concise and effective way to communicate a series of points</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 6px">Statistical data should be titled and summarised in a clear, concise format
</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 6px">Consider having a barcode that links to your project somewhere (e.g. bottom or top) in the poster could help you raise attention for your research project</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
