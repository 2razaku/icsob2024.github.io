<b style="font-size:22px; text-align:center;">Tutorial 1: Driving Digital Transformation through Digital Design Thinking: The Scene2Model Approach</b><br><br>
<b>Description</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>Innovation and transformation, as well as the emergence of disruptive business ecosystems,
supported by various software, have gained increasing significance. One approach to tackle this complex task
is Design Thinking, which applies designer problem-solving techniques for agile, ideation, prototyping, and
testing in innovative processes through collaboration among stakeholders. The goal is to generate ideas by
using different design thinking methods, based on tangible visualization of certain aspects of the problem
within a developed solution space, where collaboration among stakeholders plays a central role.</li>
</ul>
<b>Course topics</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>The tutorial will introduce participants to storyboards as a selected Design Thinking method. Haptic paper figures
(SAP ScenesTM) are used to depict scenes and build storyboards in the context of a use case. Participants will
observe the end-to-end process of a software tool-supported transformation from haptic paper objects into
digitized models. The Scene2Model software tool, not only enables this transformation but also semantically
enriches the models and allows their automated composition into storyboards. This software tool supports also
the specification of outcomes, for example for marketing purposes, or project-based new releases of certain
products/services.</li>
</ul>
<b>Format and duration</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>The tutorial will be held as a 90 min session. Ideally, the tutorial is organized with a physical presence, however,
it can be adapted to online format only as well. The tutorial combines theoretical and practical work sessions in
teams,</li>
</ul>
<b>Organisers</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>The tutorial is guided by two instructors with expertise in conceptual modelling, design thinking concepts and
methods, and the Scene2Model environment. Both instructors have previous experience in organizing and hosting
similar tutorials (e.g., at the NEMO Summer School Series) for participants with different professional
backgrounds.<br>
Wilfrid Utz received his PhD from the University of Vienna, Research Group Knowledge Engineering in
the field of metamodel design and conceptual structures. He has been involved in international research and
innovation projects and gained experience in the field of modeling method conceptualization, meta-model design,
and implementation of modeling tools using ADOxx in various application domains. His research and professional
interest relate to the knowledge representation using metamodeling concepts and platforms.
Iulia Vaidian received her master’s degree at the Vienna University of Economics and Business and gained
experience in design thinking, business process management, and conceptual modelling concepts and technologies
in her responsibilities as part of the OMiLAB team.</li>

<b style="font-size:22px; text-align: center;">Tutorial 2: IoT in Multidisciplinary Engineering for Modern Systems</b><br><br>
<b>Description</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>A Modern System is a System of Systems that is based on the aspects which are majorly
Multidisciplinary such as; Wireless Sensor Network; Data Mining; Machine-to-Machine; Geographical
Information System; Spatio-Temporal Data and Collaborative design. Open Challenges at functional
level are definition of Standard Operating Procedures; Design Integration; Data Translation; 24 x 7
Monitoring; Security and Prediction and Prevention rather than Operation and Maintenance.
Multidisciplinary Systems Engineering currently have open issues in the technical domains such as
Real Time System Design, Wireless Sensor Networks, Time-sensitive networking protocols, Data
analytics on streaming data leading to Predictive Modeling and Data storage and disaster recovery. We
will analyse them taking a number of use-cases; (i) Intelligent Traffic / Transport Management; (ii)
Security Surveillance; (iii) Emergency Response / Disaster Management; (iv) Factory Automation; and
(v) Smart Agriculture.</li>

<b style="font-size:22px; text-align:center;">Tutorial 3: Design Sprint: fast problem-solving through collaboration</b><br><br>
<b>Description</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>The tutorial proposed here presents the design sprint approach, a 4-day process
for rapidly solving big challenges, creating new products, or improving existing ones.
Developed in Google Ventures, it relies on a tight coupling between an idea and the data that
allow to verify or discard it, hence ensuring that a product does at the same time match the
business needs of the company running the sprint and the needs of the final user. The
advantages of this approach include a quick validation of new ideas before committing to a
strategic project, the alignment of different stakeholders on the objectives and challenges to be
faced, a structuring of creative thinking through visual representation, and an iterative
verification of actionable outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<b>Course topics</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>The tutorial will start from a methodological introduction of design sprint,
following with a detailed description of the activities envisioned in its application, and finishing
with a practical workshop to exemplify the application of the approach.</li>
</ul>
<b>Format and duration</b>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>The tutorial will last 180 minutes in total, including a one-hour
methodological introduction and a two-hour practical workshop.</li>
</ul>
<b>Organisers</b>

<li>Silvia Bordin is a user experience consultant and certified design sprint
facilitator. She works with medium to large companies to promote innovation by improving
their interaction with users, in terms of digital products and business processes. She holds a
PhD with distinction in Computer Science from the University of Trento and EIT Digital, where
