<p><b>PhD Retreat</b></p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li>PhD candidates are invited to attend a one-day PhD retreat in the Italian Alps. Apart from developing your research, this event is highly valued for the opportunity to expand your network by meeting fellow international PhD candidates. You will engage in research and social activities (... and have fun!). PhD candidates must register for the conference to attend. The PhD Retreat will take place on November 8th, 2022.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Posters</b></p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li>Posters are a great way to present early-stage or ongoing research. A reserved space at the conference venue will be dedicated to the exhibition of posters. Several poster sessions will be organised during the conference to allow presenters to interact with conference participants and get feedback on their work from both researchers and industry participants.</li>
</ul>
        
<p><b>Industry Presentations</b></p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li>Participants will also have free access to the South Tyrol Free Software Conference (SFScon). SFScon promotes the use of Free Software in IT infrastructures as a tool to achieve greater innovation and competitiveness (more details available <a href="https://www.sfscon.it/" target="_blank">here</a>). A selection of papers will be invited to present their work (where appropriate) to the SFSCon industry track presentations.</li>
</ul>
Please note, applications for the PhD Retreat and submissions to the Posters and Industry Track will be after 29 July 2022 (details will be released shortly).
