		<p>Companies from a wide variety of industries, from media companies to banks to industrial companies, are currently tapping into the potential of digital technologies with the concept of digital transformation. This is the first time software solutions are important for all these companies. The situation is different for software providers and in software-intensive businesses - software has always been the core of their business. Is the much-discussed concept of digital transformation relevant to them at all, is it a waste of time or is it even going in the wrong direction? This keynote presents the core elements of the concept of digital transformation and shows whether and how they can be used by software providers and software-based companies. One typical question is whether a Software Provider should have a Chief Digital Officer or not. The considerations are illustrated with practical examples.</p>
