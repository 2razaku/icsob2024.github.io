Software facilitates the vast majority of social, commercial, and governmental interactions in our society. The rules that were once implicit in person-to-person interactions or embedded in municipal bylaws are now codified into a set of instructions that govern how people can interact with organizations or with each other online. At the same time, software grassroots in the form of Free and Open Source Software (FLOSS) and civic technology initiatives are creating new ideas and alternatives. All these changes have introduced significant challenges that question established practices and norms, especially from the perspectives of ethics, equity, and sustainability. Examining the intersection of software and society is critical to informing the ethical, equitable, and sustainable use of information and software technology in the future.

This special issue aims to advance the research field of software and society by collecting high-quality research articles on the latest advances and emerging trends in the field of software and society. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

<ul style="list-style: none;">
            <li>Sustainable Transformation</li>
            <li>Digital Services and Systems</li>
            <li>Grassroots and Civic Development</li>
            <li>Diversity and Inclusion in Software Development</li>
            <li>Technology, Power, and Social Change</li>
            <li>Ethics, Equity in Software Ecosystems and Platforms</li>
            <li>Ethics in eHealth Software</li>
            <li>Equitable Cybersecurity</li>
            <li>Sustainable Development Goals and Software Technology</li>
            <li>Sustainability and Ethics in Software Production Education</li>
            <li>Legal Issues</li>

        </ul>   

We also welcome submissions that address current issues in the field, such as distributed development practices, software development for citizen sensing platforms, participatory governance software systems, and ethics or bias in AI.

This special issue provides a unique opportunity for researchers and practitioners at the intersection of sustainability and software to share their insights, experiences, and perspectives on the unique challenges and latest advancements in ethics, equity, and sustainability that we face in the field of information and software technology.

<b> Peer review process: </b>

During the peer review process, we will follow the software engineering research fieldâ€™s best practices, IST recommendations, and Elsevier guidelines. Concisely, the process is as follows.

<ul style="list-style: none;">
  
            <li>Based on the call for papers, authors independently submitted and selected ICSOB 2024 conference authors are also invited to submit extended versions of their papers through the Editorial Manager for review. </li>
            <li>Guest editors seek unbiased reviewers (2-3) for each submission and confirm that they are aware of the review standards of IST (Reviewer details are delivered to the special content editor within one week of paper submission).</li>
            <li>Guest editors will take action (accept, revise, reject) within one week of review completion. </li>
  
</ul>
